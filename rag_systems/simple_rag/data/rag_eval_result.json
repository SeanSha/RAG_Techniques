  "answers": [
    "Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are gases in the atmosphere that trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is essential for life on Earth as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate, which is the primary cause of recent climate change.",
    "The provided context does not specifically mention the role of oceans in regulating the Earth's climate.",
    "Climate change impacts biodiversity by altering terrestrial ecosystems, shifting habitat ranges, changing species distributions, and affecting ecosystem functions. This leads to a loss of biodiversity and disrupts ecological balance, particularly in forests, grasslands, and deserts. In marine ecosystems, rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and changing currents affect marine biodiversity, causing species migration and changes in reproductive cycles that disrupt marine food webs and fisheries.",
    "Rising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion, threatening homes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Low-lying islands and coastal regions are especially vulnerable, necessitating investment in adaptation measures like sea walls and managed retreats.",
    "Individuals can reduce their carbon footprint by adopting sustainable practices such as reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste, supporting renewable energy, and advocating for climate action."
